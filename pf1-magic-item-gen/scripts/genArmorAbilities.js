A suit of heavy armor or a tower shield can store one animal up to one size category larger than the wearer. A second command word releases the stored animal from the <em>hosteling </em>armor or shield. A released animal immediately awakens, appears in a space adjacent to the wearer, and can take actions on the round it appears.</p><p> Because the stored animal is sleeping rather than in suspended animation (or even hibernating), it ages and gets hungry at the normal rate while stored. A <em>hosteling </em>armor or shield automatically releases a stored animal 24 hours after it was stored inside.</p><p> This armor special ability still works on bonded magical beasts that were once animals, but not outsiders, oozes, or other exotic companion creatures.</p>"},
