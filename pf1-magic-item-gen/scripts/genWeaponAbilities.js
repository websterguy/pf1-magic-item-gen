        Concealed: {name: "Concealed", output: "Concealed", bonus: 0, priceMod: 7_500, cl: 10, aura: "trs", desc: "<p>This special ability can be placed only on a light or one-handed melee weapon. A <em>concealed </em> weapon alters its shape at its wielder's command, transforming into a non-weapon object of the wielder's choice. This object must be a mundane item whose size and shape is similar to that of the concealed weapon or smaller, and it must be sized for a creature of the same size as the weapon's intended wielder. For example, a Medium short sword can transform into a quill sized for a Medium creature, but it cannot transform into a saw sized for a Small creature. A <em>concealed </em>weapon cannot transform into a consumable item, and if its alternate form is that of a container, any contents stored within the concealed weapon's alternate form are ejected into the wielder's space when the weapon transforms back to its original form. </p><p> While transformed, a <em>concealed </em>weapon doesn't register as magical, as per <em>magic aura</em>, though it retains the weight, hit points, and any hardness of its original form. A <em>concealed </em>weapon cannot assume the form of an object made from a special material (such as adamantine) unless it is already made of that material. For instance, a wooden club cannot transform into a mithral frying pan, but a mithral dagger can. </p><p>Transforming a <em>concealed</em> weapon into a mundane form requires a standard action, while returning it to its weapon form requires a move action. This transformation lasts until it is changed back into its original form or has been left unattended for 8 hours, whichever comes sooner.</p>"},

A <em>dueling </em>weapon (which must be a weapon that can be used with the Weapon Finesse feat) gives the wielder a +4 enhancement bonus on initiative checks, provided the weapon is drawn and in hand when the Initiative check is made. It provides a +2 bonus on disarm checks and feint checks, a +2 bonus to CMD to resist disarm attempts, and a +2 to the DC to perform a feint against the wielder.</p>"},
        Exclusionary: {name: "Exclusionary", output: "Exclusionary", bonus: 0, priceMod: 3_750, cl: 1, aura: "nec", desc: "<p>When the wielder of an <em>exclusionary </em>weapon damages a creature with it, she can choose to not affect that creature with any channel energy ability she uses within the next minute. The maximum number of targets the wielder can exclude at one time is equal to her Wisdom bonus plus the enhancement bonus of the <em>exclusionary </em>weapon. If the wielder of an <em>exclusionary </em>weapon strikes a creature that would cause her to go over this limit, she loses the ability to exclude the target she has been excluding for the longest amount of time.</p>"},
        Glamered: {name: "Glamered", output: "Glamered", bonus: 0, priceMod: 4_000, cl: 10, aura: "misc", desc: "<p>A <em>glamered </em>weapon can be commanded to change its shape and appearance to assume the form of another object of similar size. The weapon retains all its properties (including weight) when so disguised but does not radiate magic. Only<em> true seeing </em>or similar magic reveals the true nature of a <em>glamered</em> weapon while it is disguised. After a <em>glamered </em>weapon is used to attack, this special ability is suppressed for 1 minute.</p>"},
        GreaterTransformative: {name: "Gtr. Transformative", output: "Greater Transformative", bonus: 0, priceMod: 15_000, cl: 15, aura: "trs", desc: "<p>A <em>greater transformative</em> weapon becomes any other weapon the wielder desires when a command word is spoken. The weapon cannot become ammunition, but can freely change between simple, martial, exotic, light, one-handed, twohanded, melee, and ranged. The weapon retains all of its enhancement bonuses and weapon special abilities. However, abilities prohibited by its current shape do not function. For example, a <em>keen greater transformative</em> weapon functions normally in the form of a piercing or slashing weapon, but cannot use the <em>keen</em> special ability when in the shape of a bludgeoning weapon. A double weapon that loses the double quality cannot use the abilities on one of its ends (wielder's choice), whereas a non-double weapon that gains the double quality applies all its abilities to only one end. When unattended for 1 day, the weapon reverts to its true shape.</p>"},

A metallic weapon cannot rust and a wooden weapon cannot rot or warp, even by magical or supernatural means. An <em>impervious</em> weapon gains double the normal bonus to its hardness and hit points for each point of its enhancement bonus. The break DC for an <em>impervious </em>weapon and the wielder's combat maneuver defense against sunder maneuvers against the <em>impervious</em> weapon each gain a bonus equal to twice the weapon's enhancement bonus.</p>"},

A <em>lesser concealed </em>weapon functions as a <em>concealed</em> weapon (above), but can transform into only a mundane object of the same size and general shape of the weapon (determined at the weapon's creation).

The wielder attempts a combat maneuver check while holding the weapon (DC = 15 + either the spell's caster level or the creature's HD); success dispels the effect. Only a single attempt can be made against each spell or effect.</p>"},
        Prehensile: {name: "Prehensile", output: "Prehensile", bonus: 0, priceMod: 2_500, cl: 7, aura: "enc", desc: "<p>This special ability can be placed only on a whip. A prehensile whip can, as a swift action, be attached to an object as if it were a grappling hook. The whip can then be used to climb surfaces or to swing across a room or any open area. By spending 1 panache point as a free action, a swashbuckler increases a <em>prehensile </em>whip's reach to 20 feet for a single attack, and can use the whip with his precise strike ability even though it's not a light or onehanded piercing weapon.</p>"},

        Sacrosanct: {name: "Sacrosanct", output: "Sacrosanct", bonus: 0, priceMod: 5_000, cl: 8, aura: "evo", desc: "<p>Taking the form of a deity's favored weapon, a sacrosanct weapon serves as both a martial implement and the corresponding deity's holy (or unholy) symbol. Once per day when the wielder uses the <em>sacrosanct</em> weapon to channel energy, she can increase the radius of the channel energy to 40 feet. They wielder must be able to channel positive or negative energy to use this ability.</p><p> Alternatively, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to use this ability instead of expending its daily use. When using mythic power to activate this ability, it can be done at will.</p>"},
        Shrinking: {name: "Shrinking", output: "Shrinking", bonus: 0, priceMod: 1_000, cl: 5, aura: "trs", desc: "<p>This special ability can be placed only on melee weapons. When the wielder issues the command word, a <em>shrinking</em> weapon shrinks to the size of a standard dagger. While in this state, the weapon deals 1d4 points of damage but is more easily concealable. When the command word is spoken again, the weapon returns to its original state.</p>"},
        Sneaky: {name: "Sneaky", output: "Sneaky", bonus: 0, priceMod: 5_000, cl: 7, aura: "nec", desc: "<p>This special ability can be placed only on a melee weapon. Once per day as a free action, the wielder of a <em>sneaky</em> weapon can designate a single foe within his melee reach as his prey. If the wielder has the sneak attack class feature, he adds his sneak attack damage to the next attack he makes against his prey, even if the wielder is not flanking and the target is not denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, as long as that attack is made before the end of the wielder's next turn. If the wielder is a rogue or slayer with the hunter's surprise talent, he can use that talent one additional time per day.</p>"},
        Transformative: {name: "Transformative", output: "Transformative", bonus: 0, priceMod: 10_000, cl: 10, aura: "trs", desc: "<p>This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A <em>transformative </em>weapon alters its shape at its wielder's command, becoming any other melee weapon of the same general shape and handedness; the weapon's categorization as simple, martial, or exotic is irrelevant. For example, a Medium <em>transformative longsword </em>can take the shape of any other Medium one-handed melee weapon, such as a scimitar, flail, or trident, but not a Medium light or two-handed melee weapon (such as a Medium short sword or a Medium greatsword). It can even take the shape of comparable weapons of different size categories. For example, a Small greatsword is a two-handed slashing weapon for a Small character, but is a one-handed slashing weapon for a Medium character, which is very similar to a Medium longsword; a Small <em>transformative greatsword</em> can thus become an actual Medium longsword, usable by a Medium creature without the -2 penalty for using a weapon of the wrong size. The weapon retains all of its abilities, including enhancement bonuses and weapon special abilities, except those prohibited by its current shape. For example, a <em>keen transformative weapon </em>functions normally in the form of a piercing or slashing weapon, but cannot use the keen special ability when in the shape of a bludgeoning weapon. When unattended, the weapon reverts to its true shape.</p>"},

        Allying: {name: "Allying", output: "Allying", bonus: 1, priceMod: 1, cl: 5, aura: "trs", desc: "<p>An <em>allying </em>weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the weapon's enhancement bonus to one weapon being used by an ally of the wielder. The wielder must have line of sight to the intended ally. As a free action, at the start of her turn before using her weapon, the wielder chooses how to allocate her weapon's enhancement bonus. The bonus to the ally's weapon lasts until the <em>allying </em>weapon's wielder's next turn. The enhancement bonus from the <em>allying </em>weapon does not stack with the enhancement bonus on the ally's weapon (if any).</p>"},

When combined with abilities like <em>bane </em>or <em>spirit-hunting</em>, the enhancement bonus increases granted by these abilities don't stack, but an extra 1d6 points of damage are added to the additional damage for each special ability beyond the first. (For example, a <em>bane blood-hunting </em>weapon would deal 3d6 additional points of damage, and a <em>bane blood-hunting spirit-hunting</em> weapon would deal 4d6 additional points of damage.) To randomly determine a weapon's designated foe, roll on the following table.

The creature struck must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save, or take 1d6 points of acid damage at the start of its turn for 1d4 rounds. Successive hits with the <em>catalytic </em>weapon increase the duration but don't add to the damage. The creature can attempt to neutralize the reaction as a full-round action as if it were on fire (including bonuses for dropping and rolling on the ground or jumping into water). Anyone who hits a creature subject to this chemical reaction with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of acid damage.</p>"},

When the wielder makes a successful attack of the appropriate type, he may choose to expend two uses of his magical ability to channel it through the weapon to the struck opponent, which suffers the effects of both the weapon attack and the special ability. (If the wielder has unlimited uses of a special ability, she may channel through the weapon every round.) For example, a paladin who strikes an undead opponent with her <em>conductive greatsword </em>can expend two uses of her lay on hands ability (a supernatural melee touch attack) to deal both greatsword damage and damage from one use of lay on hands. A given character can use this weapon special ability only once per round (even if she has several <em>conductive</em> weapons), and the power works only with magical abilities of the same type as the weapon (melee or ranged).</p>"},

If the attempt fails, the wielder can immediately attempt the same maneuver against the opponent without provoking attacks of opportunity.

Any creature that is immune to sneak attacks is immune to this penalty, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from the penalties imposed by a <em>debilitating</em> weapon. Multiple hits from multiple <em>debilitating</em> weapons in the same round do not increase the penalty or its duration. </p><p>If the wielder has the debilitating injury (<em>Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained 22</em>) class ability, this special ability increases the penalty applied by the bewildered or disoriented effects by 1. </p>"},

As long as the weapon is wielded, the wielder gains fire resistance 5.</p><p> <strong>Dominant/Commanding (opposes transmutation)</strong>: A union of enchantment and illusion magic, a <em>dominant weapon</em> functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against transmuters and against creatures with the shapechanger subtype. As long as the weapon is carried, it can absorb up to three harmful transmutation effects (such as <em>baleful polymorph</em> or <em>petrification</em>) inflicted on the wielder per day.</p><p> <strong>Jealous/Trusting (opposes necromancy)</strong>: A union of abjuration and enchantment magic, a <em>jealous weapon</em> functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against necromancers and against undead created by necromancy spells (not against self-manifested undead or undead created by the create spawn special ability). As long as the weapon is carried, it can absorb up to 3 negative levels inflicted on the wielder per day.</p><p> <strong>Miserly/Generous (opposes illusion)</strong>: A union of transmutation and conjuration magic, a miserly weapon functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against illusionists and creatures from the Plane of Shadow. The first three times each day that this weapon strikes an illusion, it automatically makes a <em>dispel magic</em> attempt to dispel the illusion.</p><p> <strong>Parasitic/Symbiotic (opposes enchantment)</strong>: A union of necromancy and transmutation magic, a <em>parasitic weapon</em> functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against enchanters and against creatures that are charmed, dominated, or otherwise under another creature's magic control. The first time each day that this weapon strikes a creature under the effects of an enchantment spell, it automatically makes a <em>dispel magic</em> attempt to dispel the enchantment. If the attempt is successful, it siphons that energy into the wielder, healing her of 6d6 points of damage (hit points in excess of maximum are gained as temporary hit points that last for 1 hour).</p><p> <strong>Sadistic/Compassionate (opposes abjuration)</strong>: A union of evocation and necromancy magic, a <em>sadistic weapon</em> functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against abjurers and any creatures with an active abjuration spell effect. A <em>sadistic weapon</em> shrouds its wielder in an aura of mock magic-when the wielder is subjected to a dispelling effect, that dispelling attempt instead targets only the aura of mock magic. If the aura is dispelled, it replenishes again in 24 hours.</p><p> <strong>Tyrannical/Liberal (opposes conjuration)</strong>: A union of illusion and evocation magic, a <em>tyrannical weapon</em> functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against conjurers and summoned monsters. The first three times each day that the weapon scores a critical hit against a creature with the extraplanar subtype, the weapon casts <em>dismissal</em> at the creature struck.</p>"},

        Runeforged: {name: "Runeforged", output: "Runeforged", bonus: 2, priceMod: 2, cl: 13, aura: "misc", desc: "<p>During Thassilon's height, many of the empire's greatest soldiers, mercenaries, and arcane assassins wielded weapons infused with two allied schools of magic that worked together to grant the wielder additional prowess over practitioners of an opposing school of magic. Weapons steeped in enchantment and illusion magic, for example, held great power over wielders of transmutation. Such weapons were often banned in Thassilon, so wary were the runelords of their propagation, yet all seven kept champions and assassins armed with <em>runeforged weapons</em> targeting their enemies' weaknesses in secret.</p><p> Each <em>runeforged weapon</em> opposes a school of magic. The wielder gains a +2 morale bonus on all saving throws against spells from the weapon's opposed magic. All runeforged weapons are, to a certain degree, empathic. They enhance sin or virtue in those who wield them, so a fighter armed with a <em>dominant weapon</em> becomes more domineering than before, for example. Anyone wielding a <em>runeforged weapon</em> takes a -2 penalty on all Diplomacy checks, as her vices or virtues are magnified at the expense of personality. No weapon can have more than one <em>runeforged weapon</em> quality at a time, and a creature that carries two <em>runeforged weapons</em> (even those o f the same type) takes a -5 penalty on all attack rolls, Will saving throws, and skill checks, as her mind is constantly assailed by multiple empathic urges.</p><p> Each of the seven Thassilonian schools of magic is opposed by a single <em>runeforged weapon</em> quality-each of these being the combination of that school's opposition schools. The seven correct component combinations and the type of <em>runeforged weapon</em> each combination creates are listed below. Note that the first name for each type of weapon listed is its sinful name- the second is the name a virtuous character can use to refer to the weapon. In any event, a <em>runeforged weapon</em> functions the same, regardless of whether it magnifies a wielder's sin or virtue.</p><p> A wielder who is considered sinful or virtuous (see page 416) with the same type of sin/virtue as a <em>runeforged weapon</em> he wields becomes more aware of danger around him-gaining a +2 insight bonus on Initiative checks and a +1 dodge bonus to AC.</p><p> The specific effects of each of the seven types of runeforged weapons are listed below.</p><p> <strong>Covetous/Charitable (opposes evocation)</strong>: A union of conjuration and abjuration magic, a <em>covetous weapon</em> functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against evokers and creatures with the fire subtype. As long as the weapon is wielded, the wielder gains fire resistance 5.</p><p> <strong>Dominant/Commanding (opposes transmutation)</strong>: A union of enchantment and illusion magic, a <em>dominant weapon</em> functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against transmuters and against creatures with the shapechanger subtype. As long as the weapon is carried, it can absorb up to three harmful transmutation effects (such as <em>baleful polymorph</em> or <em>petrification</em>) inflicted on the wielder per day.</p><p> <strong>Jealous/Trusting (opposes necromancy)</strong>: A union of abjuration and enchantment magic, a <em>jealous weapon</em> functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against necromancers and against undead created by necromancy spells (not against self-manifested undead or undead created by the create spawn special ability). As long as the weapon is carried, it can absorb up to 3 negative levels inflicted on the wielder per day.</p><p> <strong>Miserly/Generous (opposes illusion)</strong>: A union of transmutation and conjuration magic, a miserly weapon functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against illusionists and creatures from the Plane of Shadow. The first three times each day that this weapon strikes an illusion, it automatically makes a <em>dispel magic</em> attempt to dispel the illusion.</p><p> <strong>Parasitic/Symbiotic (opposes enchantment)</strong>: A union of necromancy and transmutation magic, a <em>parasitic weapon</em> functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against enchanters and against creatures that are charmed, dominated, or otherwise under another creature's magic control. The first time each day that this weapon strikes a creature under the effects of an enchantment spell, it automatically makes a <em>dispel magic</em> attempt to dispel the enchantment. If the attempt is successful, it siphons that energy into the wielder, healing her of 6d6 points of damage (hit points in excess of maximum are gained as temporary hit points that last for 1 hour).</p><p> <strong>Sadistic/Compassionate (opposes abjuration)</strong>: A union of evocation and necromancy magic, a <em>sadistic weapon</em> functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against abjurers and any creatures with an active abjuration spell effect. A <em>sadistic weapon</em> shrouds its wielder in an aura of mock magic-when the wielder is subjected to a dispelling effect, that dispelling attempt instead targets only the aura of mock magic. If the aura is dispelled, it replenishes again in 24 hours.</p><p> <strong>Tyrannical/Liberal (opposes conjuration)</strong>: A union of illusion and evocation magic, a <em>tyrannical weapon</em> functions as a <em>bane weapon</em> against conjurers and summoned monsters. The first three times each day that the weapon scores a critical hit against a creature with the extraplanar subtype, the weapon casts <em>dismissal</em> at the creature struck.</p>"},

The DC of Perception checks to hear the sound of battle increases from -10 to 10, as long as the only combatants are the wielder of the <em>silencing </em>weapon and targets affected by the weapon's muffling ability.</p><p> If the wielder confirms a critical hit with a <em>silencing</em> weapon, the target is also encased in a mobile aura of magical <em>silence</em> (Will DC 13 negates), which lasts a number of rounds equal to the critical multiplier of the weapon.
