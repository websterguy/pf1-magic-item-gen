## Description
This module assists in creating custom weapons and items for the PF1e system in Foundry VTT.

You can select any base weapon or armor item from the pf1 compendia and alter its properties. The created item can be places into the world items or given directly to an actor. The item will have updated price, weight, hp, hardness, caster level, and aura based on the size and bonuses chosen. Since the system only supports one aura type, the caster level will be set to the highest caster level among all bonuses chosen, and the aura will be set to "miscellaneous" if the aura schools don't all match.

The module does not implement any of the special abilities in any way, but the rules description for each ability is added to the item's description.
